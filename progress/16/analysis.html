				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>The opening sentence of the entire article in <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1] </a>would be the thesis statement for three reasons. First, it mentioned the keyword that will be discussed in the entire article, which is <q> synthetic chemicals called phthalates. </q>Second, it indicates that phthalates are around us and may cause early deaths, which is the core message the article conveys. In addition, the last phrase<q> a new study found</q> indicates that this article is mainly based on a new study.</p>

				
				<p class="quote"><q> <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in hundreds of consumer products</span> such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys,  <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">may contribute to some 91,000 to 107,000 premature deaths a year among people ages 55 to 64 in the United States, a new study found</span>. <span class="joint">&#9658;</span> People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality, according to the study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Pollution. <span class="joint">&#9658;</span> The study estimated those deaths could cost the US about $40 to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity. <span class="joint">&#9658;</span> "This study adds to the growing data base on the impact of plastics on the human body and bolsters public health and business cases for reducing or eliminating the use of plastics," said lead author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at NYU Langone Health in New York City.</q></p>

Therefore, what the author is trying to convey through this article is that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">considering how phthalates damage our health and how greatly people are exposed to phthalates, it is crucial for us to take precautions in order to protect ouselves.<span>
				</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors like BPA, which can still be found in the linings of canned goods and paper receipts, Trasande said. <span class="joint">&#9658;</span> "First, avoid plastics as much as you can. Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily," he suggested. "In addition, cooking at home and reducing your use of processed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with." Here are other tips to reduce you and your family's exposure:
Use unscented lotions and laundry detergents.
Use cleaning supplies without scents.
Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic or wood to hold and store foods.
Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned and processed versions.
Encourage frequent hand washing to remove chemicals from hands.
Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7
