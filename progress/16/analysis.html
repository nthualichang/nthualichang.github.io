				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>The opening sentence of the entire article in <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1] </a>would be the thesis statement for three reasons. First, it mentioned the keyword that will be discussed in the entire article, which is <q> synthetic chemicals called phthalates. </q>Second, it indicates that phthalates are around us and may cause early deaths, which is the core message the article conveys. In addition, the last phrase<q> a new study found</q> indicates that this article is mainly based on a new study.</p>

But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that the <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge</span>.</q></p>
