					Have you ever had the experience of staring into an artwork and feeling confused? Art is often considered to be exclusive and could only be done and understood by a selected few. However, it turns out that art is just another form of communication that anybody can get involved. Today I would like to share a Japanese Manga that allows me to view art in a way that I have never imagined, which is “Blue Period.” The story follows a boy, Yatora Yaguchi, who was inspired by his senpai’s artwork and stumbled into the world of painting.
