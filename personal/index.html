			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Wen-Chin Chang and I am a senior in Tsing-Hua University double majoring in Foreign Language and Literature and Quantitative Finance. I was born in Canada, yet was soon brought back to Taiwan before I could produce a word. Since then, I have been living with my family in Taipei. Growing up, I have been a curious and introspective kid, often pondering on my thoughts and tend to find interests in many things. Whether it is ballet, piano, flute, yoga, figure skating or painting, I always try to seize the moment and enjoy both the accomplishment and frustration brought by these activities. Besides these hobbies, I am greatly fascinated by the diversity of languages and cultures around the world. Getting exposed to different cultures, I realized that behind every language is a unique perspective towards the world, and that the world before me expands as I learn a new language. Aspiring to learning as much language as I can, I joined a language exchange program recently to polish my Japanese skill and communicate with Japanese people, trying to unveil the different perspectives and culture behind the language. I canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds!
